ASOIAFBot
=========

A reddit bot that retrieves information about all things in the series A Song Of Ice And Fire. The current version is a quick and dirty prototype and can therefore contain bugs and other pesky things. 


Features
=========
<ul>
<li>Retrieve information about houses. Currently supported regions are: Crownlands, Riverlands, Stormlands, Dorne and a small portion of the Iron Islands</li>
</ul>


Usage
=========
To use the bot all you have to do is include the available search terms in one of your comments on reddit.

<h3>Houses</h3>
To retrieve information about a given house, just include the search term !House(name) in your comment. Note that the result may differ from house to house. If there is, for example, no information about the founder that column will not be displayed in the result. Below you will find the result from the search term !House(Targaryen)
